                <dt>1. Meta description tag</dt><br>
                <dd>The meta description tag must not exceed 160 characters (or 1000px) in length.
                    (The character count also includes spaces and punctuation.)<br><br>

                </dd>
                <dt>2. Content Type</dt>
                <dd>The content type tag specifies which character set is used in the document. This
                    tag is important because otherwise, it can lead to errors, for example when
                    displaying German umlauts. You can use text/html as well as text/richtext together
                    with the respective ISO-character set, separated by a semicolon, for this meta tag.
                   <ul>
                       <li>ISO-8859-1 is the character set for English, French, and German</li>
                       <li>ISO-8859-2 is used in Slavic and some Central European languages</li>
                       <li>ISO-8859-3 is intended for Turkish and Maltese, among others</li>
                    </ul><br>
                    Example:<br><br>
                    <div class="code-block">
                    &#60;<span class="code-element">meta</span> <span class="code-attribute">http-equiv</span>="content-type" <span class="code-attribute">content</span>="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1">
                    </div>
                </dd>
                <dt>3. Language</dt>
                <dd>The meta element language informs search engines about the language in which a
                    page was written.<br>
                    Example:<br><br>
                    <div class="code-block">
                    &#60;<span class="code-element">meta</span> <span class="code-attribute">http-equiv</span>="language" <span class="code-attribute">content</span>="en"><br>
                    </div>
                    Especially useful for multi-lingual websites, this meta tag offers the
                    opportunity to tell search engines which page was written in which language and
                    is thus important for international indexing.
                </dd>
                <dt>4. Robots</dt>
                <dd>With a robots tag, you can tell spiders or crawlers which information of your
                    page they should analyze and which they should ignore. Example:<br>
                    <div class="code-block">
                    &#60;<span class="code-element">meta</span> <span class="code-attribute">name</span>="robots" <span class="code-attribute">content</span>="nofollow"><br>
                    </div>
                    The value nofollow signals to crawlers not to follow the links on a website.
                    Other possible values ​​for robots meta tags are:<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>noindex: The respective page should not appear in search results.</li>
                        <li>noarchive: Search results must not display the version of a page stored
                            in the search engine's cache.</li>
                        <li>nosnippet: No extract from a page (neither text nor video) should be
                            displayed in search results.</li>
                        <li>noimageindex: Crawlers may only index the text, but not the images of a
                            page.</li>
                        <li>notranslate: Google should not offer a translation of a page via Google
                            Translate.</li>
                    </ul>
                </dd>
                <dt>5. Refresh</dt>
                <dd>A refresh tag can be used to reload a web page after a certain amount of time or to redirect
                    visitors to another web page after a certain amount of time. Example:<br><br>
                    <div class="code-block">
                    &#60;<span class="code-element">meta</span> <span class="code-attribute">http-equiv</span>="refresh" <span class="code-attribute">content</span>="5;url=https://www.seobility.net"><br>
                    </div>
                    By specifying 5 and the URL, visitors will be redirected to Seobility's website
                    after 5 seconds. Today, however, several browsers, including Firefox and
                    Internet Explorer, enable the deactivation of refresh tags.
                </dd>
                <dt>6. Canonical Links</dt>
                <dd><h3>6.1 Correct use of canonical links</h3>
                    A canonical link is added to the <span class="code-inline">&#60;head></span> of a webpage to indicate the
                    canonical URL version. For example, if the webpages
                    <span class="inline-link">http://www.example.com/product.html</span> and <span class="inline-link">http://www.example.com/product_print.html</span>
                    (the print version) refer to the same content and you want to indicate to search
                    engines that the first one is the canonical URL version, you can add the following
                    link to the print version page:
                    <div class="code-block">
                    <span class="code-element">&#60;link</span> <span class="code-attribute">rel</span>="canonical" <span class="code-attribute">href</span>="http://www.example.com/product.html" />
                    </div>
                </dd>
                <dt>7. Domain Name</dt>
                <dd><b>Meaning:</b> The domain of a website is what we refer to as a “web address” in
                    everyday language. It’s a translation of an IP address into words, making it more
                    memorable and user-friendly than a long string of numbers.<br>
                    Each existing domain can only be assigned to one website and is therefore unique.
                    However, <strong>the term domain should not be confused with the term URL, as a domain
                    is only part of an entire URL.</strong> For example, consider the following address,
                    <span class="inline-link">www.seobility.net</span>:
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="inline-link">www</span> - This is the subdomain. Subdomains can be used for specific areas of
                            a website that should be separated from the actual site, such as "mobile"
                            or "blog". The most common subdomain is www, which stands for world wide
                            web. Despite its omnipresence, you don’t necessarily have to enter it
                            into your browser in order to access a website.</li>
                        <li><span class="inline-link">seobility</span> - This is the domain name. This is the unique name of a website,
                            e.g. the company name. It can be chosen as needed and represents the
                            unique part of a domain. Apart from hyphens, no special characters are
                            allowed. The domain must not begin or end with a hyphen.</li>
                        <li><span class="inline-link">net</span> -  A TLD is also called domain extension and can be country-specific
                            (ccTLD, eg .us, .de, ...) or generic (gTLD, eg .com, .net, .info, ...).
                            In addition, there have been so-called new TLDs (nTLD, e.g., .boston or
                            .photography) for some time now which allow a more differentiated
                            geographic or thematic classification of your website.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <u>Things to remember:</u><br><br>
                    - Not too many characters for the domain name<br>
                    - As short and simple as possible
                </dd>
                <dt>8. URL</dt>
                <dd>Definition - The URL (abbreviation for "Uniform Resource Locator") of a web page
                    is the unique address of this page on the internet, i.e. what is often referred
                    to as a "web address" in colloquial language. A URL is the unique path that leads
                    to a certain resource within a protocol. The URL of a website consists of the
                    domain and the exact path of the individual page. To access a specific page on
                    the internet, either the URL or the IP address can be entered into the browser's
                    address bar. When entering the IP address, you also use the form of a URL, for
                    example: http://192.168.0.1
                <h3>8.1 Components of a URL</h3>
                Consider the following URL - <span class="inline-link">https://www.seobility.net/en/keywordmonitoring/</span>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="inline-link">https</span> - Network protocol. The first part of a URL tells the browser which
                        network protocol to use and defines how data is transmitted over the internet.
                        The <strong>HTTP protocol (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)</strong> is usually used for accessing
                        websites via a browser. A more secure alternative is <strong>HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer
                        Protocol Secure)</strong>. Other well-known network protocols include <strong>FTP (File
                        Transfer Protocol)</strong> for transferring files and <strong>SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer
                        Protocol)</strong> for transferring e-mails.</li>
                    <li><span class="inline-link">www</span> - Third level domain (or subdomain). Although the third-level domain "www"
                        (world wide web) has become a standard over time, it is not absolutely
                        necessary for a URL. Further subdomains could be shop.domain.de or
                        blog.domain.de, which refer to separate areas of a website.</li>
                    <li><span class="inline-link">seobility</span> - Second level domain (or first level domain). The second-level
                        domain contains the actual name of a website (e.g. "seobility") and can be
                        purchased from various hosting providers.</li>
                    <li><span class="inline-link">net</span> - Top level domain. The top-level domain represents the ending of a
                        domain. Known domain extensions are for example "de" (Germany), "com"
                        (commercial) or "net" (network).</li>
                    <li><span class="inline-link">en/keywordmonitoring</span> - File path. The file path contains the name of the
                        called file as well as its storage location. It can also be followed by
                        dynamic parameters that determine the structure of a page. For example, in an
                        online shop, the products displayed can be sorted by popularity, price, etc.</li>
                </ul>
                </dd>
                <dt>9. Aspects of Mobile Optimization</dt>
                <dd>Basically, there are three main possibilities for the configuration of a mobile website. These are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Responsive web design</li>
                        <li>The creation of a separate mobile website</li>
                        <li>Dynamic serving</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>9.1 Responsive Web Design (RWD)</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><div class="code-block">&#60;<span class="code-element">meta</span> <span class="code-attribute">name</span>="viewport" <span class="code-attribute">content</span>="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0 /></span></li>
                        <li>CSS media queries</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>9.2 Mobile version of a website</h3>
                    The second of the above variants is to create a separate mobile version of your
                    website, which has its own URL. In such a case, if users access your website
                    from a mobile device, they are redirected to the mobile version of your page
                    using HTTP redirects. However, the disadvantage of this alternative is that it
                    can cause problems with duplicate content.<br>
                    To make it easier for Google to evaluate the different URLs, you should add a
                    rel="alternate" tag to the HTML code of the desktop version of your URL. This tag
                    points to the mobile version of the URL:
                    <div class="code-block">&#60;<span class="code-element">link</span> <span class="code-attribute">rel</span>="alternate" <span class="code-attribute">media</span>="only screen and (max-width: 640px)" <span class="code-attribute">href</span>="http://m.example.com/"></div>
                    In addition, you should add a canonical link to the mobile version of your page,
                    which refers to the desktop version, in order to prevent said problems with
                    duplicate content:<br>
                    <div class="code-block">&#60;<span class="code-element">link</span> <span class="code-attribute">rel</span>="canonical" <span class="code-attribute">href</span>="http://www.example.com/"></div>
                    <h3>9.3 Dynamic serving</h3>
                    The third and final alternative for configuring a mobile site is dynamic serving.
                    If you choose this variant, different HTML and CSS codes are delivered depending
                    on which user agent is recognized. In this case, the mobile site is a reduced
                    version of the actual site. The main disadvantage of this alternative is the high
                    error rate in the identification of the user agent. An important element in this
                    approach is the vary HTTP header. Through this, the server sends a message that
                    the Googlebot for smartphones should also crawl the corresponding page. Without
                    the vary HTTP header, Google wouldn't know that the HTML code for mobile user
                    agents is being modified.<br>
                    This header could look like this:
                    
                    <div class="seo-header-1">
                        <pre>
GET /page-1 HTTP/1.1

Host: www.example.com

(...rest of the HTTP request header...)
                        </pre>
                    </div>

                    <div class="seo-header-2">
                        <pre>
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

Content-Type: text/html

Vary: User-Agent

Content-Length: 5710

(... rest of the HTTP response header...)
                           </pre>
                     </div>
                <h3>9.4 Further Aspects of Mobile Optimization</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Minimize the number of JS and CSS files</li>
                    <li>Adapt page menus to smaller viewports</li>
                    <li>Adjust font sizes so the users can read texts without having to zoom the page</li>
                    <li><div class="code-block">&#60;<span class="code-element">link</span> <span class="code-attribute">rel</span>="icon" <span class="code-attribute">sizes</span>="192x192" <span class="code-attribute">href</span>="/icon.png" /></div>
                        This tag is for the icon that appears when users add your page to the home
                        screen of their mobile devices.</li>
                    <li>Apple devices have their own meta tag: <div class="code-block">&#60;<span class="code-element">link</span> <span class="code-attribute">rel</span>="apple-touch-icon"
                        <span class="code-attribute">href</span>="/apple-touch-icon.png" /></div></li>
                </ul>
                <h3>9.5 Frequent Errors</h3>
                You should avoid the following frequently occurring errors regarding mobile

                    <h3>11.1 Basic Problems</h3>
                    For most users, it is not of particular importance whether they access a website
                    via a www or a non-www link. However, the fact that a website is accessible with
                    or without the input of “www” can seriously impact a website's search engine
                    ranking.<br>
                    When a URL is written in two different ways (www and non-www) it means the same
                    website appears online under two different domains.
                    <h3>11.2 Possible Solutions</h3>
                    If a website is accessible with both a www and a non-www link, a 301 redirect to
                    the preferred domain should always be set up. The HTTP status code 301 - moved
                    permanently - indicates to browsers that a requested file has been permanently
                    moved to a different URL and that the entered URL is no longer valid.<br>
                    One option, when using the Apache web server, is to set up the redirect by using
                    an .htaccess file. For example, to redirect the URL example.com to the URL
                    www.example.com, save the following source code as a .htaccess file or insert it
                    into an existing .htaccess file:<br>
                    <div class="htaccess">
                        <pre>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^www.example.com$
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.example.com/$1 [R=301,L]
                        </pre>
                    </div>
                    If you want to redirect to the version without www instead, the URL must be
                    inserted without www.<br>
                    Another simpler option that delivers the same results is to create a redirect via
                    a vHost configuration:
                    <div class="v-host">
                        <div class="code-block">
                            <pre>
&#60;VirtualHost *:80>
: ServerName example.com
: Redirect permanent / http://www.example.com/
&#60;/VirtualHost>
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                        <div class="code-block">
                            <pre>
&#60;VirtualHost *:80>
: ServerName www.example.com
: # real server configuration
&#60;/VirtualHost>
                            </pre>
                        </div>    
                    </div>
                </dd>
            </dl>
        </div>
    </body>
